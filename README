System requirements/installation and execution instructions

0. Running environment, any machine/OS with Python3.0 installed.(numpy, tensorly, sklearn, gensim are prerequisite Python libraries)
1. Put all csv data file under the “data” folder.
2. Go to the “Code” folder using your command line tool. (Shell or CMD) 
3. Execute the program with “python3 main.py”.
4. Wait for around 20 seconds, you will see the following information during this progress.
“loading csv data into memroy...
loading completed!
preprocessing data...
preprocessing completed!”
5. After you see a “query>”, you can running your query now.
6. How to run each query command, please refer the section “Interface Specifications” for more detail.

Interface specifications

The system-level interface is by command line. The following commands should produce the corresponding outputs for each task. 
p3_task1a <user_id> <PCA|SVD> [pf]  
Param 1: user_id, a valid user id without quote, e.g. 41154 
Param 2: model, e.g. PCA 
Param 3: pf, enable task2 probabilistic feedback. 
p3_task1b <user_id> [pf] 
Param 1: user_id, a valid user id without quote, e.g. 41154 
Param 2: pf, enable task2 probabilistic feedback. 
p3_task1c <user_id> [pf] 
Param 1: user_id, a valid user id without quote, e.g. 41154 
Param 2: pf, enable task2 probabilistic feedback. 
p3_task1d <user_id> [pf] 
Param 1: user_id, a valid user id without quote, e.g. 41154 
Param 2: pf, enable task2 probabilistic feedback. 
p3_task1e <user_id> [pf] 
Param 1: user_id, a valid user id without quote, e.g. 41154 
Param 2: pf, enable task2 probabilistic feedback. 
p3_task3 <l> <k> 
Param 1: l, the number of layers in LSH. 
Param 2: k, the number of hash functions in each layer 
For the further interface information, please follow the instruction in each command. 
For the interface of task2/4, also follow the instruction indicated in each task1/3 command. 
p3_task5 <NN | DT | SVM> <r> 
Param 1: classification algorithm from NN|DT|SVM, e.g. NN. 
Param 2: r range 
reset wc 
Helper function to release the memory
